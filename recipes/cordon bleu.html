  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This entree is easy and delicious! It's one of my husband's favorites! Try to use the largest chicken breasts you can find so you'll be able to roll them easier.</p>
  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> This chicken cordon bleu casserole recipe starts with a package of wide egg noodles.</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken</strong> and <strong>ham:</strong> You'll need cooked, cubed chicken and cooked, cubed ham. This is a great use for leftover meat, if you have it. </li>
    <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Melt Swiss cheese alongside the chicken and ham in the casserole. Parmesan cheese is essential for the crispy topping. </li>
    <li><strong>Soup:</strong> The creamy sauce starts with a can of reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of chicken soup. Of course, you can make your own cream of chicken soup at home.</li>
    <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>sour cream:</strong> Finish the creamy sauce with equal parts 2% milk and sour cream. </li>
    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Cook the bread crumbs and Parmesan in hot butter. </li>
    <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Use store-bought seasoned bread crumbs or make your own at home. </li>
    
  </ul>
